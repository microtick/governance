# Community Pool Spend - New Logo and Web Desing attending new rebranding agreement at www.discoverydex.io

By proposal number 16 (https://explorer.microtick.zone/proposals/16) it was agreed to change the name of Microtick to DiscoveryDEX. Proposal number 17 received fewer votes. 

## The Problem
We need a new informative website and a new logo.
The information on www.microtick.com is still valid for DiscoveryDEX for the time being.

## The Solution.
I found a company that could do both jobs for us and submitted a quote on 13 May (https://discord.com/channels/739872992669991003/739878687142314037/974621289148981328). 

**Deaccel Partners** is the company to do both jobs for $3,000.00. 
A sample of their work is this:

The complete portfolio is this:

In these 10 days no other DAO member has submitted a quote, no other alternative.

So I propose, allocate 4600 TICKs from Community Pool to a multisign account managed for 3 members of the DAO to pay this job.
