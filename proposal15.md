# New proposal: Coinlisting

## The problem
**Microtick** is made up of a very diverse community. 
Actually only a few (volunteers) people and entities actively collaborate in the maintenance and development of the project. 

There is no team dedicated to development, marketing or administrative tasks.

Our project is not known outside Cosmos (even inside) because we are not listed in CMC or Coingecko, among others.

Therefore the visibility of the project is very low and its opportunities for expansion are minimal, even if we are listed in Osmosis.

Technical-administrative needs:

 * Microtick needs to list it on the most important coin-trackers
 * MT needs to have endpoints that provide information on:
     * Total supply
     * Max supply
     * Circulating supply
     * Bonded supply
     * Community Pool supply
     * Distribution of tokens
     * etc, etc.



## The solution

It is necessary that someone is in charge of this great administrative task that will open the doors to new users, markets and to enhance the value of our project.

I propose to perform these tasks in exchange for a number of TICKs tokens from the Community Pool. 

The concrete proposal is to receive 6,000.00 TICKS (3,7% of Community Pool's total) for doing the administrative work of listing request and setting up the necessary APIs.

The period to do this is 6 months and 4 more sites can be added to the list below (1 listing request per week).

The way to add another site should be including the name of the Coin Tracker in the memo field when the holder cast his/her vote. The four most voted nominees will be included in the list. 

The method of payment will be as follows:
* Multisig account owned by **Mark** (Microtick val.), **Jayjay** (3TeKos val.) and **Raul** (Spanish-Node Val.) will receive the proposed total amount.
    *   address: `micro1nvelag2d9clw2m4vfdj66jylfkxw8qaqnk8yma`
    *   pubkey: `micropub1ytql0csgqgfzd666axrjzq655q6y43w5fz8m7mvk687vrqdx7rk0h2wfe5dq6e2lczsu6j33f5fzd666axrjzq6hrjcpdwz5v2kqn2vlwm3fhqjwx6rz0qr8q6xxm4fqd3x28f6zvcfzd666axrjzquhrlqtsp8633z33drsvma95wrcnq3ysdmjmyhusdm5qf8evnq4v5s6rssk`
* In the first 5 days of each month Javier will receive 1000 TICKS (1/6 of the total).
